    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>We are a non-profit company based out of Central America with a goal of repopulating our forests.</p>
    <p>Rainforests are a massive role in planet preservation, as they provide much of the oxygen we breathe and habitats for countless species.</p>
    <p>Join us in our mission to do our part of saving the Earth by donating $2 to plant a new tree!</p>
